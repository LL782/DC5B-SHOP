      Your feedback is not only welcome, it&apos;s the way this business is
      going to grow. Within reason, we want to provide artwork in exactly the
      way you want it.

      T-shirt, coaster, wall vinyl, colouring in book, huge oil paintings, brass
      etching. All formats considered. If anything strikes a chord do say.
