## Tech

The following are technical notes for the website development.

### Summary

- It's a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application
- Deployed and hosted via my [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
- Product and payment handling integrated with my [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/dashboard)

### Getting Started

```bash
yarn i
yarn dev
```

Dev runs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Managing Products

Follow the existing examples

1. Add products to [Stripe > Products](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products)
1. Add the same title, subtitle and image to the ideas data in `data`
1. Fill out the other attributes of the idea
1. Copy the `price` data from Stripe over to the `dev` or `prod` files ("dev" equates to "[test mode](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products)")

#### Test Mode

When developing a new idea we can add a work in progress to the `dev` file and safely merge this to main and deploy it. We only release the idea to production when we add the idea to the `prod` file.
