# Data Viewer

The following are technical notes for the data viewer development.

## Summary

- It's a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) application
- Deployed and hosted via my [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
- Reflecting data stored via my [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

## Getting Started

```bash
npm i
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

Dev runs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Work in progress

1. The plan is to create a dashboard to see the web actions
2. Currently actions are written to the database by [IDEA.DC5B.COM](https://idea.dc5b.com/)
3. This "Data Viewer" app will read that data.
