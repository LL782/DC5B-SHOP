# Data Viewer

The following are technical notes for the data viewer development.

## Summary

- It's a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) application
- Deployed and hosted via my [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
- Reflecting data stored via my [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

## Getting Started

```bash
yarn i
yarn dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn dev -- --open
```

Dev runs at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
yarn run build
```

You can preview the production build with `yarn run preview`.

## Work in progress

1. The plan is to create a dashboard to see the web actions
2. Currently actions are written to the database by [IDEA.DC5B.COM](https://idea.dc5b.com/)
3. "Data Viewer" is a new app to read that data
